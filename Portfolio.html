    <h1>The Family Medicine Portfolio</h1>
    <h3>What is it?</h3>
    <p> The porfolio is a unique (and mandatory) project you create during your first and second years of residency to document your experience, presentations, module assignments, and rotation evaluation forms.
    </p>
    <p>This is a file in which students will keep:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>All assignments from the completed modules</li>
      <li>Evidence of attendance of clinic session</li>
      <li>Evidence of attending CME sessions and a report of each session attended</li>
      <li>Reflections from rotations, modules and conferences</li>
    <h3>How is it graded?</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Module assignments (80 marks)</li>
  <p>Each module will be given a mark. This will be determined by averaging the marks given for the assignments for that module. The marks for the individual modules will be then averaged, and converted to a mark out of 80 for the final Portfolio mark.</p>
<li>Clinic sessions</li>
<p>Clinic sessions will be assessed by means of an evaluation form that will record attendance and performance at clinic sessions.</p>
<li>CME Sessions (10 marks)</li>
<p>Evidence that the student has been attending well selected CME courses (both local and abroad), which have relevance to primary care (6 marks).
  <p>Evidence that there has been learning beacuse of CME exposure (4 marks).</p>
  <li>Reflections (10 marks)</li>
  <p>Evidence that students reflect on his/her learning, trying to relate learning to previous knowledge and experience, and evidence that the student is using reflective pieces as an instrument for growth (6 marks)</p>
  <p>Evidence that the student has experienced positive, expected change because of this course - change in attitude towards medicine, their learning, patients, and the ehalth care system (4 marks)</p>

</ol>
